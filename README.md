A CIPP Liner Thickness Calculator built with Flask

__________________________________________________

Cured in Place Pipe liner is used to rehabilitate utility pipelines
that have structurally degraded. The resin impregnated liner is pulled
or inverted into place within the host pipe, then cured until the resin
is set. This new pipe within a pipe can be designed to support hydraulic
or structural and hydraulic loads depending on the application and
condition of the host pipe. 

This python web app takes user inputs and calculates the minimum
required thickness of the CIPP liner fabric. This app currently supports
calculations for gravity (non pressure) pipelines such as sanitary sewers.

This calculator does not take into account environmental variables such
as temperature, operator experience, or other in situ conditions that
can effect the success of a liner rehabilitation. Always consult an
Engineer prior to making costly decisions about pipe rehabilitation.
